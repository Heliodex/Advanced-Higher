## Future maintainability

Use of modular functions, UI components, clear variable names, inline comments and doc-comments, formatting tools, version control commits with clear and concise messages, type annotations in the codebase, and the documentation you are reading right now all contribute to the maintainability of the project.

However, the project uses a fair amount of non industry-standard tooling and custom solutions for problems that could more easily be solved in other languages. The structure of the routing system is familiar to me as it was inspired by other popular web frameworks, but it may seem convoluted or unnecessary to others. Use of a custom templating language may also have been unnecessary, as it could have been replaced with a more standard solution like simple string interpolation or a more popular and well-known templating language. (In truth, I was halfway through implementing a custom programming language for the project before abandoning the idea.)

While these solutions were helpful as a learning experience during the project, they may not be the best choice for long term maintainability.
